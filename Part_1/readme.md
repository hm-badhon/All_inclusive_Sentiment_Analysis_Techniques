# Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using a Naive Bayes classifier. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine if a piece of text expresses a positive or negative opinion. In this project, we'll analyze movie reviews to classify them as either positive or negative.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: We use a dataset of movie reviews provided by the NLTK library. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative.
2. **Feature Extraction**: We convert the text data into numerical vectors that the machine learning model can understand.
3. **Model Training**: We train a Naive Bayes classifier to learn how to classify the reviews based on the features.
4. **Evaluation**: We test the model on new data to see how well it performs.
5. **Prediction**: We use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Install Required Libraries

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn
```

### 2. Download the Data

The script automatically downloads the movie reviews dataset using the `nltk` library. If needed, you can manually download it by running:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("movie_reviews")
```

### 3. Run the Code

You can run the code to train the model and make predictions. The code does the following:

- **Loads the Data**: Retrieves movie reviews and their sentiments.
- **Prepares the Data**: Converts text reviews into numerical features.
- **Trains the Model**: Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to learn from the data.
- **Evaluates the Model**: Checks the model's performance on a test set.
- **Predicts Sentiment**: Predicts whether new reviews are positive or negative.

### 4. Understand the Output

After running the code, you will see the accuracy of the model and a classification report. Here is the classification report generated by the model:

```
Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

         neg       0.80      0.80      0.80       199
         pos       0.80      0.80      0.80       201

    accuracy                           0.80       400
   macro avg       0.80      0.80      0.80       400
weighted avg       0.80      0.80      0.80       400
```

- **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Support**: The number of actual occurrences of the class in the specified dataset.

### 5. Prediction Results

The `predict_sentiment` function allows you to predict the sentiment of new reviews. For example, running the following code:

```python
print(predict_sentiment("I absolutely loved this movie! It was fantastic."))
print(predict_sentiment("It was a terrible film. I hated it."))
print(predict_sentiment("The movie was okay, nothing special."))
```

Will produce output similar to:

```
positive
negative
neutral
```

(Note: The actual output will depend on the model's predictions and the data used.)

## Explanation of the Model

### Naive Bayes Classifier

- **What Is It?**: Naive Bayes is a type of machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It's called "naive" because it assumes that the features (words in our case) are independent of each other, which is not always true in real life.
- **How It Works**: It calculates the probability of each sentiment (positive or negative) given the features of a review. The model then predicts the sentiment with the highest probability.

### Why Use It?

- **Simple and Fast**: Naive Bayes is easy to implement and works well for text classification problems.
- **Good Performance**: Despite its simplicity, it often performs surprisingly well on text data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic approach to sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier. It helps you understand how to process text data, train a model, and make predictions.
