# To improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes model for sentiment analysis
## Consider the following strategies:

### 1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - **Remove Stop Words:** Stop words like "is", "and", "the" might not add much value to sentiment analysis. You can remove them to focus on more meaningful words.
   - **Lowercasing:** Convert all text to lowercase to avoid treating "Movie" and "movie" as different words.
   - **Remove Punctuation:** Punctuation marks can be removed as they do not contribute to sentiment.
   - **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Use stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form (e.g., "loved" to "love").

   ```python
   from nltk.corpus import stopwords
   from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
   import string

   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
   stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

   def preprocess_text(text):
       # Convert to lowercase
       text = text.lower()
       # Remove punctuation
       text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
       # Remove stopwords and lemmatize
       text = " ".join(
           lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words
       )
       return text

   df["cleaned_review"] = df["review"].apply(preprocess_text)
   ```

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Instead of using `CountVectorizer`, try using `TfidfVectorizer` which considers the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.
   - **N-grams:** Use bigrams or trigrams in addition to unigrams to capture phrases like "not good" which might be more indicative of sentiment.

   ```python
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=2000, ngram_range=(1, 2))
   X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df["cleaned_review"])
   ```

### 3. **Model Tuning**
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with the parameters of the Naive Bayes model (e.g., `alpha` for smoothing).
   - **Try Different Algorithms:** While Naive Bayes is good for text classification, you could also try other models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or ensemble methods like Random Forest.

   ```python
   model = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.1)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

### 4. **Ensemble Methods**
   - **Voting Classifier:** Combine multiple models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM using a voting classifier.
   - **Bagging/Boosting:** Use bagging methods like Random Forest or boosting methods like XGBoost to improve performance.

### 5. **Data Augmentation**
   - **Increase Training Data:** If possible, increase the size of the training data by augmenting it or adding more labeled examples.
   - **Synthetic Data:** Use techniques like back-translation to create synthetic data and increase dataset diversity.

### 6. **Cross-Validation**
   - Use k-fold cross-validation to get a more reliable estimate of model performance and to tune hyperparameters more effectively.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

   scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
   print(f"Cross-validation accuracy: {scores.mean()}")
   ```

### 7. **Error Analysis**
   - Analyze the errors made by your model. Look at misclassified examples to understand why the model failed and whether there are patterns that could be addressed through feature engineering or model changes.

### Example Implementation:
Integrate these techniques into your existing code to see if they improve the model's accuracy. You may need to experiment with different combinations of preprocessing steps and models to find the best approach.
