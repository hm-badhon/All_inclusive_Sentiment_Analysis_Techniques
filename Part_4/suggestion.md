# Achieving 84% accuracy is a solid improvement, but if our goal is to reach around 90%, further refinements are necessary.

##  Here are some additional strategies we can apply:

### 1. **Use a More Advanced Model (e.g., BERT)**
   - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is one of the most powerful models for NLP tasks. Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model on your dataset can significantly improve accuracy.

### 2. **Stacking Models**
   - Combine the strengths of multiple models using a stacking approach where predictions from different models are combined to form a final prediction.

### 3. **Increase the Size of the Dataset**
   - **External Data:** Augment your dataset by including additional sentiment datasets (like IMDB reviews).
   - **Data Augmentation:** Apply techniques like back-translation to create variations of your existing data.

### 4. **Model Ensembling**
   - **Voting Classifier:** Combine multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) and use a majority vote for the final prediction.

   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

   # Initialize models
   model1 = LogisticRegression(C=10, max_iter=100)
   model2 = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.1)
   model3 = SVM(kernel='linear', C=1)

   # Combine models
   ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[
       ('lr', model1), ('nb', model2), ('svm', model3)], voting='hard')

   ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = ensemble.predict(X_test)
   print(f"Ensemble Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
   ```

### 5. **Experiment with Feature Engineering**
   - **TF-IDF Parameters:** Tweak parameters like `max_df`, `min_df`, and `sublinear_tf` in `TfidfVectorizer`.
   - **Word Embeddings:** Use pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe or FastText.
   - **Topic Modeling:** Integrate LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify topics and add them as features.

### 6. **Model Regularization**
   - Adjust regularization parameters like `C` in Logistic Regression to prevent overfitting.

### 7. **Error Analysis**
   - Review misclassified examples in detail. Look for patterns or commonalities in the errors that could inform further feature engineering or data cleaning efforts.

### Next Steps:
1. **Fine-Tune a BERT Model**: If possible, fine-tune a BERT model on your dataset.
2. **Use Ensemble Techniques**: Implement a stacking or voting classifier with several strong models.
3. **Augment Data**: Increase the size and diversity of your training dataset.
